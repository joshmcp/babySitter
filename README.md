# babySitter

This app will calculate your babysitter wages for one evening, by using your input
start time, and end time.  You may also enter bedtime, if applicable.  Wages are computed differently
based on bedtime, and whether you worked after midnight.

Hourly wage for ALL hours after midnight is $16, regardless of whether child is in bed.
Hourly wage before midnight, when child is in bed is $8.
Hourly wage before midnight, when child IS NOT in bed, is $12.

Enjoy!
